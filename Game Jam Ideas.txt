You are the camera in an action movie/TV show. Your job is to direct the action of the movie so that
the main character survives and everybody else dies.

Name Idea: Lights, Camera, Competence

Gameplay:
- You use the mouse to change what the camera is looking at.
- Zoom in and out with the scroll wheel (maybe don't use?).
- Click to flash the camera.
- Right click for slow-motion (or maybe to stop the main character from moving)?
- If the camera is not on the main character, a timer ticks down.
- If you lose focus of the main character for long enough or the main character dies, it's
game over.
- The main character automatically navigates to be within the camera's line of sight.
- The main character will pick up weapons it runs over on the way to your camera.
- Your camera also has an effect on how the main character or enemies perform. Enemies will
normally be very accurate (maybe get rid of this accuracy with the camera flash or just
focusing on them)? And the player will normally suck at killing things unless the camera is focused on
them.
