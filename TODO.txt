Update builds

Things for later updates(?):
Get fake camera to work in camera space to add post processing?
Make the timer somehow more visually clear in cinematic mode?
Spend a lot of time cleaning code.
Enemy that runs away from your camera
Enemy or powerup that when you're hit, staying in the camera damages you, and staying
out of the camera heals you.
Enemy that chases you and shoots bullets at a distance (Pathfinding might be good)?
New weapons?
