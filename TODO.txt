Things for later updates(?):

Actual options menu (Music volume, sound effects volume, customize post processing?)
Enemy that runs away from your camera
Enemy or powerup that when you're hit, staying in the camera damages you.
Enemy that chases you and shoots bullets at a distance (Pathfinding might be good)?
