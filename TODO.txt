Make tougher enemies towards the later levels (add different colors to show more toughness) (Maybe
starting around Hallway?)

Add more enemies to levels and make them deal more damage (Game becomes slightly easier?)? (Maybe after
some playtesting)

Things for later updates(?):

Actual options menu (Music volume, sound effects volume, customize post processing?)
Enemy that runs away from your camera
Enemy or powerup that when you're hit, staying in the camera damages you.
Enemy that chases you and shoots bullets at a distance (Pathfinding might be good)?
